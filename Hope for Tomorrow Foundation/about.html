      <h2>Our History</h2>
      <p>
        Established in 2018, the Hope for Tomorrow Foundation is a registered Section 18A non-profit
        organization dedicated to supporting underprivileged children's education in the townships and
        rural areas of Gauteng. The organization was created to address post-apartheid educational
        inequality.
      </p>
      <p>The foundation focuses on three main initiatives:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Digital literacy workshops</strong> to equip learners with essential technology skills.</li>
        <li><strong>Scholarships for Grades 10–12</strong> to help students access further education opportunities.</li>
        <li><strong>After-school tutoring</strong> in Afrikaans, English, and math to strengthen foundational learning.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Since its inception, the foundation has partnered with 15 schools, recruited 150 volunteer tutors
        ranging from college students to retired teachers, and assisted over 2,500 children across Soweto,
        Alexandra, Katlehong, and surrounding communities.
