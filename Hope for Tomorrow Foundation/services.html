    <h2>Our Services</h2>
    <p>
      At the Hope for Tomorrow Foundation, our work is centered on breaking cycles of poverty and creating opportunities 
      for underprivileged children in Gautengâ€™s townships and rural areas. Since our establishment in 2018, we have designed 
      programs that not only address immediate educational needs but also build long-term pathways for success.
    </p>

    <h3>1. Digital Literacy Workshops</h3>
    <p>
      We run digital literacy workshops to equip learners with essential computer and technology skills. 
      In a world driven by technology, access to digital knowledge helps children prepare for the modern workplace 
      and gives them the tools to succeed in school and beyond.
    </p>

    <h3>2. High School Scholarships (Grades 10-12)</h3>
    <p>
      Through our scholarship program, we provide financial support for learners in Grades 10-12. 
      These scholarships give deserving students the chance to complete their high school education 
      and pursue postsecondary studies or career opportunities.
    </p>

    <h3>3. After-School Tutoring</h3>
    <p>
      Our after-school tutoring program provides additional support in core subjects:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Afrikaans</li>
      <li>English</li>
      <li>Mathematics</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These sessions are led by volunteer tutors ranging from college students to retired teachers, 
      ensuring that every child has the academic support they need to thrive.
    </p>
