      in underprivileged communities. We believe that every child deserves a chance to learn, grow, and

  <section id="overview">
    <h2>Organisation Overview</h2>
    <p>
      Established in 2018, the Hope for Tomorrow Foundation is a registered Section 18A non-profit 
      organization that supports underprivileged children's education in the townships and rural areas 
      of Gauteng. Founded by former teachers <strong>Nomsa Mthembu</strong> and <strong>Pieter van der Merwe</strong>, 
      the organization was created to address post-apartheid educational inequality.
    </p>
    <h3>Our Work Focuses on Three Main Initiatives:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Digital Literacy Workshops</strong> – equipping learners with essential technology skills.</li>
      <li><strong>Scholarships for Grades 10-12</strong> – enabling learners to access further education opportunities.</li>
      <li><strong>After-School Tutoring</strong> – offering extra support in Afrikaans, English, and math.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Since our inception, we have partnered with 15 schools, recruited 150 volunteer tutors ranging 
      from college students to retired teachers, and assisted over 2,500 children in Soweto, Alexandra, 
      Katlehong, and surrounding communities.
